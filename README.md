# Excel Data Analysis Challenge

## Overview
This assignment is part of a comprehensive data analytics bootcamp designed to develop skills in data analysis and visualization using Microsoft Excel. In this module, students were introduced to Excel as a powerful tool for analyzing datasets and uncovering trends. The challenge provided practical experience with advanced Excel features such as pivot tables, conditional formatting, and statistical analysis.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this assignment, students learned to:
- Use Excel to analyze and organize large datasets.
- Apply advanced features like pivot tables, VLOOKUPs, and conditional formatting.
- Create compelling visualizations to communicate insights.
- Perform statistical calculations such as mean, median, variance, and standard deviation.

## Assignment Details
The dataset for this challenge consists of 1,000 sample crowdfunding projects. The assignment's goal was to uncover market trends by applying the following steps:
1. **Data Formatting:** Utilize conditional formatting to visually represent the `outcome` column (successful, failed, live, or canceled).
2. **Calculations:**
   - Calculate `Percent Funded` and format it with a three-color scale.
   - Compute `Average Donation` for each project.
   - Split categories into `Parent Category` and `Sub-Category`.
3. **Pivot Tables:** Create pivot tables to analyze:
   - The number of campaigns in each category and sub-category by outcome.
   - Trends over time using converted date fields.
4. **Charts:** Generate a variety of visualizations, including:
   - Stacked-column pivot charts for categorical trends.
   - Line charts to track trends by year and parent category.
5. **Statistical Analysis:** Evaluate success metrics with summary statistics, such as:
   - Mean, median, and standard deviation of backers for successful and unsuccessful campaigns.

## Tools and Technologies
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Conditional Formatting
- Statistical Analysis Tools

## Results
The analysis provided insights into the factors influencing the success or failure of crowdfunding campaigns. Students gained experience in identifying trends, visualizing data, and generating actionable insights.
